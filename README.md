## Usage

### Git hook

To set it up in a Git hook, add it to your pre-commit hook. For example, using Husky, add this line to your .husky/pre-commit file:

```
prevent-file-changes -f README.md sensible.sh -p ".\*\\.env" ".*\\.log"
```

### CLI

You can run it as CLI if globally installed:

```
prevent-file-changes -f README.md sensible.sh -p ".\*\\.env" ".\*\\.log"
```

Or using `npx` if locally installed:

```
npx prevent-file-changes -f README.md sensible.sh -p ".\*\\.env" ".\*\\.log"
```

Command-line options:

- `--filesPaths` or `-f`: A list of specific files to protect.
- `--filesPatterns` or `-p`: A list of regular expressions defining patterns of files to protect.

### Library module

Or you can use it as a script importing it as a module and passing to it the files or regex's to protect as arguments:

```
import { preventFileChanges } from 'prevent-file-changes';

preventFileChanges({ files: ['file1.js'], patterns: ['.*\\.env'] });
```
